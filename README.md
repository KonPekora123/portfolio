I am excited to submit my portfolio for consideration for enrollment in the 3rd year of BSIT at Davao del Norte State College. 
Over the past two years, I have dedicated myself to academic excellence, personal growth, and professional development. 
This portfolio is a reflection of my journey, showcasing my achievements, skills, and the knowledge I have acquired thus far. 
I am eager to continue my education and contribute to the dynamic learning environment at DNSC.
